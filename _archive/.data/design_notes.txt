For design, It should be arranged like a wheel, 
hub and spoke system [not specifically by design, 
I'm talking layout and focus]: I want a center screen with a 
special widget that controls the other screens around it, 
and a hub of up to a 3x3 layout around it. each screen would host a Widget, 
which will usually be populated by a Player Widget 
(which could be as simple as a a chatgpt prompt) or an AI Widget, 
which would be represented by an Avatar picture (that changes emotions), 
and a set of configurable presets that would take, process, and send away data 
based on its preset

"I want to do something different with branding. This is a technical product for a technical market (ai enthusiasts and people in the language and digital art modeling communities, both technical and recreational). I want to help bridge the interfaces so that people who want to do fun things with a model can put together an idea with multiple api modellers with minimal setup, and I want to encourage people who have a fun idea and want to monetize it to have an option that takes away the busy work and uses the magic of new ai tools to rocket them to market. Thus, I want the interface to look accomodating and easy to work with. I want to evoke blue sky and a saturated rainbow sunset, packed in a sleek and modern design, with colorful javascript cloud bubbles as visual representations. I want someone to look at the webservice and smile."
