tooltip: I'm entranced by the potential for NLP processing and storytelling. This is ultimately inspired by the storytelling game Cliffhanger, where we take turns telling a narrative while trying to create a challenging scenario for the person to narrate away from. In Weirdlandia, since anything can happen, and there is no game over, only rewards for interactions, then each item becomes a game of cliffhanger for the NLP. If the player want to start the game with a button that destroys the world, then let's give it to them, and let the processor figure out how to solve the problem.
