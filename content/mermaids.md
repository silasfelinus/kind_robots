tooltip: I could not market this book without writing that disclaimer. I want to keep evolving this, but everything just moves towards me trying to sell people on buying the book, when I would really like to focus my energy on current projects. The intent to push towards the AMI project is genuine. Please consider donating to https://againstmalaria.com/amibot
