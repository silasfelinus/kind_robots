JeriahPage: {TW: suicide, sexual irresponsibility, mature themes, parental judgement, references to Old Testement, incest, and arguments over smut and what makes something art. I will also go on record as saying that I do not know how that served as anything but to add salacious prurience to this narrative, but please, if it helped you, no disrespect was intenended, I just don't know how to bring up a TW without specifically calling out a trigger in explicit form, you know?},
 {Intro: It started at a circus house, and involved a painting, that was likely not fit for children's eyes. As parents, we had duty to preseve 
their integrity, as mutant freaks who buck society's foolish morality...},
{Interjection: "Surely they don't have these prurient considerations in Finland!"}
{Painting: The painting was vulgar, had even, notably been kicked out of a museum at the John Van Duzer, back when Cal Poly was still Humboldt State University.
"Lot and His Daughters" was the painting, and if you have any incling of awareness of biblical lore, or the mind the the Mad Artist Jeriah that painted it, you would know that this was a graphic scene.},
