tooltip: This project started as a development lab in python and gradio, but I spent most of my time developing the docs and outlines and realized I had a LOOOOONG way to go before I could make my own modular front-end dev lab, no matter how nice it looked in my head. I began building this in November 2022, I'm writing this September 4, 2023.
