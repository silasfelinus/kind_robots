tooltip: Welcome to the Kind Robots! Part active development lab, part anti-malaria fundraiser, and part a place to show off some slick coding skills. I'm Silas Knight and I made this using Nuxt 3, Typescript, Prisma, Vue 3, Nuxt Content 2, and Pinia.  I'm a self-taught full-stack developer with five years of industry-adjascent experience (4 years as an multi-ISP tech support phone operator, 1 year as an on-call network admin, and 3 years personal experience running containerized community webapps for my Unraid linux homelab. I've specialized in front-end development using Node.js and API-based jamstack architecture. I'm looking to break into the game development industry ($80k or higher, $120k+ preferred), or to code for a non-profit organization ($60k+, plus benefits).  If you are looking for a multi-talented coder and problem solver, message me at silas@kindrobots.org.
