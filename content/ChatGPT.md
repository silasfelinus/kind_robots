tooltip: This was built as a method to test streaming, but at this moment, it's just a generic chatgpt interface. It uses 3.5 out of the box, but setting the openAI key in settings to a chatGPT 4 api key (if you have one) would get better memory and problem solving (Though I'm working to iterate that out)
