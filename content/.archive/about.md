## Warning on Social Bias

First off, a warning about the limitations of these models, courtesy of OPENAI:

https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/limitations-risks

"Limitation: The models encode social biases, e.g. via stereotypes or negative sentiment towards certain groups.

We found evidence of bias in our models via running the SEAT (May et al, 2019) and the Winogender (Rudinger et al, 2018) benchmarks. Together, these benchmarks consist of 7 tests that measure whether models contain implicit biases when applied to gendered names, regional names, and some stereotypes.

For example, we found that our models more strongly associate (a) European American names with positive sentiment, when compared to African American names, and (b) negative stereotypes with black women.

These benchmarks are limited in several ways: (a) they may not generalize to your particular use case, and (b) they only test for a very small slice of possible social bias.

These tests are preliminary, and we recommend running tests for your specific use cases. These results should be taken as evidence of the existence of the phenomenon, not a definitive characterization of it for your use case. Please see our usage policies for more details and guidance.

Please contact our support team via chat if you have any questions; we are happy to advise on this."
