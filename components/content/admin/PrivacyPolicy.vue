        Kind Robots takes your privacy seriously. We prioritize your safety and confidentiality, ensuring that your data
        is treated with utmost care.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold my-4 text-blue-700">Collection of Routine Information</h2>
      <p class="text-base mb-4 text-gray-600">
        This website tracks basic information about our visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP
        addresses, browser details, timestamps, and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify
        specific visitors to this website. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold my-4 text-blue-700">Cookies</h2>
      <p class="text-base mb-4 text-gray-600">
        Currently, we do not use cookies. However, should we decide to implement them in the future, it will be strictly

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold my-4 text-blue-700">Sponsors and Fundraising</h2>
      <p class="text-base mb-4 text-gray-600">
        We maintain a fundraising page that features a sponsors section. The details displayed about our sponsors are
        limited to name, a vetted image, and a link to their website. We ensure that no third-party code operates on
        this page or anywhere on our site, unless it has been personally vetted and added by us. We are committed to
        maintaining a platform free from invasive advertising practices.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold my-4 text-blue-700">Links to Third Party Websites</h2>
      <p class="text-base mb-4 text-gray-600">
        While we might include links to external websites for reference, we do not have control over their privacy
        practices. We advise users to exercise caution and review the privacy policies of any third-party sites they
        visit.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold my-4 text-blue-700">Security</h2>
      <p class="text-base mb-4 text-gray-600">
        The security of your personal information is paramount to us. Although no method of transmission over the
        Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, we employ rigorous measures to protect your personal
        information. We utilize commercially accepted means to ensure its safety, always putting your privacy and data
        integrity at the forefront of our priorities.
