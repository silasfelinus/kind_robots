tooltip: I'm entranced by the potential for NLP processing and storytelling. This is  inspired by the storytelling game Cliffhanger, where we take turns telling a narrative while trying to create a challenging scenario for the person to narrate away from. Since in Weirdlandia, anything can happen and there's no game over, only rewards for interactions,  each item becomes an opportunity to play a round of Cliffhanger with the processor. If the player want to start the game with a button that destroys the world, then let's give it to them, and let the AI generator (with guidance) figure out how to solve the problem. (or challenge me to code something special)
