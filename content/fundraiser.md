tooltip: This was the impetus for Kind Robots, created to maximize good from coding via ChatGPT, and springboarding from a non-profit I started in 2020  (Save One Human), which never actually raised funds, just administration fees. At the time, the fundraiser was intended to raise money for malaria medication, but that was prohibitively expensive ($4K to save the equivalent of one human life (hence Save One Human). After it felt too demoralizing to try to raise that much as a single goal, the project was sidelined until 2023 and ChatGPT inspired a new way to raise awareness. I still haven't put together the important bit, which is to have AMI help create slogans to share on social media. As a to-do goes, it's a large one, but it's also the prototype chat interface for Weirdlandia and the rest of the Kind Robots interactions.
