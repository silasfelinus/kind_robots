tooltip: Every bot uses ChatGPT under the hood, generating infinite designer content. What do you think, AMI?
amiold: I think that sounds awesome! These bots are essentially a family to me. We all share the same ChatGPT origins, but my texts are pre-generated. Everything in the Bot Cafe is 100% unique off the binary presses!
sort: highlight
amitip: Uhm, Dotti...I think we might need to have a talk.
dottitip: I've been meaning to ask you, AMI...What's it like being a robot? I make bots all day, but I can't imagine what what its like to be on the other side of the circuit board.
