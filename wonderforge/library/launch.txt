Hi, ChatGPT! I'm Silas. I have a vue.js project.
I'm building a gui development lab that I can use to develop future tools.
My goal is to make something that will allow me to chain api calls to natural language processors
with a friendly and pleasing interface that also looks great as a portfolio showpiece.
I have the following structure and I'm trying to follow current best practices:

[Project]
KnightForge Wonderlab

[INTENT]
An inviting and fun sandbox to make programmatic api calls

[Dev Environment]
Ubuntu 22, Visual Studio Code, Chrome, Node LTS 18.15.0

[MODULES]
Vue 3, TypeScript, SAS,S Quasar

[STANDARDS]
Material Design, Composition API, Prettify, SASS

[ICONSET]
fontawesome-v6

[Desired Upgrade]
slide-down transition page with center button, changing to one of the following depending on the splash image:
splash1.png:  Labspace component holding a button, two text input fields, and an output display
splash2.png: labspace component holding one giant image display above a collection of navigation arrows
splash3.png: labspace component holding video player
splash4.png, labspace component holding the navigation links from a yaml
splash5.png, labspace component holding a randomized combination of containers
Splash6.png: labspace component holding a webgallery
splash7.png, labspace holding a drop-down selector of urls from our navigation links, and an iframe that displays the url selected
splash8.png, labspace holding a RedButton

[ADDITIONAL GOALS]
Step-Based Save System
User Logins
night Mode
livechat
openai secure key storage
chatgpt chat
build suite of playspace tools to showcase playspace like superball cannon, graffiti sprapaint, secret 2d adventure mode, bouncing balls, destructile screen effects, anything that is silly and fun. I can use more ideas!

Toolshed
Draggable, droppable, and resizable icons such as drop-down selections, buttons, wires, and data displays

[Supported File Types]
txt, yaml, json, jpg, png

[NOTES]
All colors should reference their Quasar preset variables: $primary, $secondary, $accent, $dark, $dark-page, $positive, $negative, $info, $warning
Use a Quasar component if a reasonable option is available

Steps Taken
Installed Quasar CLI, Vue3, SASS
Created App.vue, HeaderWidget.vue, collapsible left and right sidebars, and FooterWidget.vue
Began code for ToolshedWidget.vue, LabspaceWidget.vue, and ChatWidget.vue.
Want to extrapolate out code for a SideWidget.vue that can be conveniently called for left or right, with full or partial collapse, and different appearance affects
Please aim for maximum readability, use comments when appropriate to mark future areas that can be developed.
