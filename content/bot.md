tooltip:  Currently this operates as a straightforward chatgpt 3.5 interface, though it can be upgraded with ChatGPT4 in the settings if you have an API key. The module system is in development, but will provide a lot clearer function on the website's design once constructed. I consider this a design project until I get the modules and abilities to make and edit art. They were once an intimidating aspect to the design, but now I'm just fighting to have enough time to put it all together. This was an enormous solo project, but the education and workspace benefits gained thus far have been transformative.
