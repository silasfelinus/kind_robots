tooltip: Kind Robots is hosted via my Unraid Ubuntu homelab. What began as a modest community media server became an extensive network of community webapps. I maintain multiple ubuntu workstations, including a 168TB 20-hard rive NAS running 40+ dockerized containers, including two heavily kitted Stable Diffusion Webui art generators.
