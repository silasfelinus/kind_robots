Web Project Outline: Widget Webapp Superforge


Objective: Create a user-friendly portal to explore, create, launch, chain, and monetize AI API webapps, using python3.8, flask, and gradio

A solo coding project to launch my web-business, by Silas Knight & ChatGPT


Current Status: Backend infrastructure has been built up from scratch with an eye for modularily and consistent coding practices. 
Github: https://github.com/silasfelinus/serendipity/tree/main
Python3.8, flask, pytest, logging, Github Actions CI testing has been set up
We can launch an instance of gradio, and have a host of prompts that can be turned into webapps, we have not yet stitched that together.
Work has been done on branding and development tools.
We have concept art to work with
We have a self-hosted Mongo database, but haven't coded it into the app

Project Scope:
A single page website experience for the end-user. Simplified interface, with colorful rectangular Widgets that can be customized depending on the webapp. The Interface should be accessible as its own input/output widget. Modular design is very important. we are creating a playspace for API-webservices, so we need a drag-and-drop interface and have some fun javascript code to connect apis together. 
Social elements are vital for this project. We'll need user logins, a livechat function, and customizable chatroom widgets that can connect to multiple channels and input/output streams.
