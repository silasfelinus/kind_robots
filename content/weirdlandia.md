tooltip: This is in development. I would like it to expand into a full kickstarter, but I want to get it running as this prototype first. I've mapped out character select, genre and scenarios, skill checks, moral quandary, and a reward system. The inspirations have been Night Vale, Weird West, and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. (Game function inspirations were Kingdom of Loathing and well, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and every other text-adventure)
