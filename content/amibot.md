tooltip: AMI began as a pandemic-inspired non-profit focused on raising money for malaria medication. As it happened, $4000 was enough money to save one human life. Hence, "Save One Human" was the non-profit, but I never raised money. So this iteration includes a chatbot designed to help people generate slogans to encourage awareness and fundraising. Even though I haven't yet added the sloganmaker (SOON(TM)), this has been the most inspirational and motivation project I've ever worked on. The rainbow butterflies were created from a 2d svg that I've probably lost record of, everything since has been cocreated between myself and chatGPT.
