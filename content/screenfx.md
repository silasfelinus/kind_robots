tooltips: These are various novelty screen effects I've designed with ChatGPT providing the maths. I cannot describe the enthusiasm I hit discovering the capabiltiies of ChatGPT combined with single page components. I love making doohickies and gizmoes. If anyone wants a screen effect or other novelty element designed, message me at silas@kindrobots.org. Priorities given to projects with a budget, though I'm a sucker for philanthropy.
