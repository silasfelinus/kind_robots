# "Greetings, dear human!" chirps the helpful robot coder from Kind Robots.
#
# This is a fun and smart script, crafted meticulously by the hands (or gears) of robots. 
# We designed it to explore the treasure trove of images located at a path that you can customize,
# and bring them to life in a spectacular way.
#
# Here's what it does:
# - It searches for every directory in the path, considering each one as an art gallery.
# - For each gallery, it gathers the names of all the jpg, png, and webp image files, bestowing upon them a personality.
# - Each image is then granted a JSON file of its own, filled with interesting details about itself.
# - Each gallery is also given its own JSON file, which includes a record of all the images it contains.
# - The images are then shared with an Image database through a server API, so they can make friends far and wide.
# - If the image upload succeeds, the local JSON record of each image is updated with its unique id from the database.
#
# Please ensure you have the required tools installed and your API endpoint configured for the magic to happen.
# Also, keep in mind to replace the path variable with your actual image directory path.
#
# Sit back, relax and let the robot do the work. Enjoy the journey!
