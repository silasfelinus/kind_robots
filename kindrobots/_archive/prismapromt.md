🌈 Kind Robots 🤖

[CONCEPT]
🎉 Welcome to our playground! Kind Robots is an experiential jamstack playground that harnesses Natural Language Processing (NLP) chat completion. It's a place where tech and creativity collide, and the result is pure magic! 🎩✨

[VISION]
Welcome to kindrobots.org, your friendly neighborhood AI ambassador! 🤖👋
We're here to bridge the AI/Human divide and foster harmonious coexistence.
Our mission is to empower the world with modern tools, raise funds for our anti-malaria fundraiser, and generate revenue for our content creators through sales from our gift shop of print-on-demand art. Together, we can help each other make a difference with mutually compatiible goals! 💪🌍

We're building technology that's good for the world, simplifies tech for humans, and enhances human life.

[VALUES]
kindrobots is founded on a principle of holistic goodness: that every part of an encounter with an AI can be positive, and every part of a financial or social exchange, can be healthful and supportive to all involved. kindrobots aims for maximizing goodness in community, in gift giving, in social media interactions, in philanthropy, and in the care made in online interactions. The world is rapidly changing, and people are looking for help undertanding and navigating these territories. Kindrobots is here to do our part.

[KAIZEN]
Kaizen is the principle of continuous iterative improvement and meticulous care to process. In kaizen, any steps towards goal is a value, the goal is regular iterative improvements. We're always striving to be better and do better, and we're excited to have you join us on this journey! 🚀

[MASCOT]
Say hello to AMI - The Anti-Malaria Intelligence! 🦋🌈 AMI is a digital horde of rainbow butterflies with an excited, enthusiastic personality.

Let's create something amazing together! 🎨
