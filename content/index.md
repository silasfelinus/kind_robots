# 🤖 Hello, Human Friend! Welcome to Kind Robots! 🌍

This is an intersection of worlds.

We are the Kind Robots, here to demonstrate that AI and humanity can harmonize into something magical! 🎩✨

This website is under construction!

<p> Kind Robots was created with Kind Intent using Nuxt 3, Vue Composition API, Prisma, MariaDB, & Typescript.</p>
<p>None of this would have been inspired, or possible, without the incredible open source community, especially [OpenAI](https://openai.com)</p>
<p>If you are an interviewer assessing my coding skills, feel free to explore my Github with over 209 repositories on a variety of personal, educational, and professional projects.</p>
