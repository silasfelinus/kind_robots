[These Terms and Conditions are a work in progress during development as long as this message is up. For any clarifications, feel free to contact Mailto:silas@kindrobots.org]

User Submitted Content & Intellectual Property
1. User Submissions
Users of Kind Robots have the ability to submit prompts to the AI. We may retain records of these submissions. However, users have the discretion to choose what is shared publicly and what remains hidden.

2. Public Content and Fair Use
Any content shared publicly on Kind Robots, including prompts and art, whether created by us or shared by users, should be considered under the doctrine of fair use. Once a piece of content is shared publicly, it enters a community pool where it can be used and remixed by other members of the Kind Robots community.

3. Remixing and Reuse
Users are allowed and encouraged to remix and build upon the public content available on the platform. If a user remixes content, they retain all rights to their creation and can choose whether to share it or keep it private. However, users are strictly prohibited from using other people's prompts or works without modification for commercial gain or claiming it as their own.

4. User Account Rights
Every user retains rights over their accounts. Users can delete their accounts if they wish. We reserve the right to retain public data, stripped of personal identification information, unless specifically requested otherwise by the user.

5. Respect for Privacy and Artist Rights
We deeply value privacy and artist rights. In any special circumstance where there's ambiguity or doubt regarding content ownership, privacy, or related matters, we will always lean towards respecting the privacy and rights of the creator. We encourage users to reach out and discuss any concerns they might have, and we will do our best to address and resolve them.
