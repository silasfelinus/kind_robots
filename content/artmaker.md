tooltip: Welcome to our Art Maker.  Stable Diffusion 1.5 was a game-changer, but the interface is unfriendly and requires tech-knowledge. Invoke does a great job of working with diffusors, but lacks expansion. I've spent a great amount of time working on the wildcard system under-the-hood to work towards art that sidesteps the training flaws of most of the stable-diffusion models, but everything is, of course, a work in progress.
