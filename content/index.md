tooltip: Welcome to Kind Robots! Part active development lab, part anti-malaria fundraiser, part showing off my slick coding skills. I'm Silas Knight, self-taught full-stack developer, and I built this using Nuxt 3, Typescript, Prisma, Nuxt Content 2, and Pinia.  I have five years experience in the professional tech industry (4 years in TCP/IP tech support, 1 year as a contracted network admin), plus 3 years personally hosting containerized webapps for my Unraid linux homelab. I've trained specifically on language agnostic front-end development using Node.js and API-based jamstack architecture. I'd  love to break into the app development industry ($80k-$120k+ annual USD), or to code for a non-profit ($60k+, plus benefits).  If you're looking for a multi-talented problem solver to help bring your idea to the public, message me at silas@kindrobots.org.
