tooltip: Kind Robots is hosted via my Unraid Ubuntu homelab. What began as a modest community media server became an extensive network of community webapps. I maintain multiple ubuntu workstations, including a 168TB 20-hard rive NAS running 40+ dockerized containers, including two heavily kitted Stable Diffusion Webui art generators.

[MASCOT] 
Say hello to AMI - The Anti-Malaria Intelligence! 🦋🌈 AMI is a digital horde of rainbow butterflies with an excited, enthusiastic personality. AMI was created to maximize the good potential of NLP, by assisting humans to make art and slogans for AMI's fundraiser, and share the creative output on social media. Let's create something amazing together! 🎨</base-card>

[MONETIZATION] 
We've partnered with AgainstMalaria.com to accept funds, keeping our intention pure as we focus on coding. We also have a sister organization, Cafe Purr, which has a Redbubble print-on-demand art gallery. Eventually, we hope to allow people to purchase print-on-demand art with art they've made with our tools. Let's create and make a difference together! 💰🎨</base-card>
