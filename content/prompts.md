tooltip: This was built to learn React. I'd started building this site with Vue/Quasar, Inertia Laravel, and then Nuxt 3/Prisma. At the Vue Forge Hackathon, someone shared a jobhunting anecdote about being told to learn React if they want to get work. So...this was strongly built on the back of a three 1/2 hour youtube tutorial that took me three days to digest. But now I feel much more secure in switching frameworks, and appreciating the node.js and Javascript under the curtain. Typescript has really assisted in helping me understand Object-Oriented programming. If you try to login from here, it will probably not work.  Try https://kindprompts.vercel.app/
