Vision Plan - WonderWidgets Unleashed üöÄ

Join our coding adventure to revolutionize AI API interactions by transforming them into customizable, shareable, and fun WonderWidgets!

Core Stack: Python 3.8, Quart, and Gradio, running in multiprocess for the ultimate fusion of Gradio's simple API calls and Quart's limitless CSS and JS styling options.

Value Proposition: Got a cool idea? Let's team up and bring it to life as a market-ready web app with just a single click. It's coding magic!

The Dream:
A playful single-page Wonderwidget lab showcasing programmable, themeable WonderWidgets.
An API webservice playground featuring dynamic JavaScript and drag-and-drop functionality
Entertaining idle animations and text scrolls to keep people entertained while waiting for the next process.
Jazz up the experience with personalized, themed avatars.
Let's get social: user logins, live chat, and customizable ChatWidgets for one-of-a-kind conversations.
The Ultimate Vision: An all-in-one portal that turns complex API interactions into child's play through an intuitive, user-friendly interface. 
Let's inspire fellow coders to explore, create, and share their WonderWidgets with the world!

Our Progress So Far:

Consciously-crafted infrastructure built with modularity, flexibility, and clean coding in mind.
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/silasfelinus/serendipity/tree/main
Python 3.8, Quart, and Gradio running smoothly in a multiprocess environment
Pytest, logging, and GitHub Actions continuous-integration frameworks are curently passing initial tests.
Library of Custom Prompts itching to be turned into awe-inspiring WonderWidgets.
5 custom css packages for a modular interface that fits a multitude of visions.
Various art assets that need to be stitched in by the world's most awkward html designer.


Vue the Neighborhood:
LabWidget.vue: Our friendly-gui featuring a customizable grid for building, editing, and sharing WonderWidgets. (and of course, the lab itself is a Wonderwidget)
HeaderWidget.vue: collapsible header with artwidget icons
SideWidget.vue: collapsible sidebar with navigation lines (and artwidget icons)
WidgetShed.vue: drag and drop icon to save/load widgets, or through into the TrashWidget

And of course, Wonderwidget.vue, our core function! 

WonderWidget: A custom control panel that can act as a supercharged chat window, data handler, or one chain in a web of api calls.

PromptWidget - a configurable text packet intended for a natural-language api such as ChatGPT
ChatWidget: a Multi-room livechat interface with openai integration
BotWidget: friendly avatars representing connections to language processor apis such as Chatgpt
LibraryWidget: CRUD database access
ArtWidget: image display
DJWidget: send and receive audio data
