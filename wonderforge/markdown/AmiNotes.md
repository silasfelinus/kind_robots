Propsectus: AMIbot was created to produce something literally as ethical as possible with my tech skills.
Funds raised (as of 5/20/23): $60 (from my seed money). 
History: AMI emerged from Save One Human, a non-profit I started in 2020 (github.com/silasfelinus/SaveOneHuman) but SOH raised fees instead of funds. It is currently non-active. I intend to start-it up again Soon(TM), but in the interest of expediency and a demonstration of good intent, I've turned to Against Malaria to handle fundraising, which gives me more time to code.

Amibot is designed to engage people in chats, and encourage social sharing and donations to the site. The organization was chosen based on a web recommendation and I'm not affiliated in any way with the funds. They track donations based on the cost of mosquito nets, so at this point, Amibot has encouraged the purchase of 30 mosquito nets for children in Africa. (It's a start.)

Comments: Since focusing on Amibot as my primary tech push, I've found my motivations and productivity increased. I have a clearer time talking to people about Amibot than I do about any personally financial project.

Time to get the non-profit rolling again.
