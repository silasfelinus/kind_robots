# Hidden author's note
This was a book written by a young man. I share his body, but I do not identify with his perspectives anymore. 

The novel is fun, but it commits at least three cardinal sins that make me hesitant to recommend it unqualified to a modern audience, most especially its unironic use of the [magical negro trope ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Negro).

There is a lot of positive intent in this novel, peppered over-liberally with enough $5 words to make sure the reader knew that the writer was vERy SmArT, and a flagrant theft of Practchett's "almost invisible" concept (fans of [Soul Music](https://www.amazon.com/Soul-Music-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0062237411) may easily recognize the concept of Bernard's "nearly invisible" superpower-slash-personality).

At this point, any movements to rewrite the novel feel like reconstructionism. Despite its flaws, it represents 6 years of effort and intent, and its release after a [successful kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/silasknight/mermaids-of-venice) was a personal milestone (as much as my experiences as a European busker which inspired the storyline.)
