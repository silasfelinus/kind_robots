tooltip: I don't think this qualifies as a game. I made it with chatGPT in about an hour, then it went through another iteration after my 11-year-old tapped it to 1000. I replicated the experience after adding more sentences and extending the confetti effect to 1000 with unique phrases. I believe it would make a great experience when tied in with the AMI project with slideshow and music effects.
