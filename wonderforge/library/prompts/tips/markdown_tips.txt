I apologize for any confusion or limitations in displaying the markdown correctly. I'll try to provide a better example for the next round. Meanwhile, I'll list some common markdown elements you can use to format your text:

Headers: You can create headers using the # symbol followed by a space and the text. You can use 1-6 # symbols for different header levels.

Copy code
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

##### Header 5
###### Header 6
Emphasis: You can emphasize text using asterisks or underscores.

These are some of the essential markdown elements. Keep in mind that not all markdown renderers support the same features or have the same syntax. Additionally, some platforms, like GitHub, have their own extended markdown syntax for additional functionality.
