üåà Kind Robots ü§ñ

[CONCEPT]
üéâ Welcome to our playground! Kind Robots is an experiential playground that harnesses the power of modern tech services and Natural Language Processing (NLP) chat completion. It's a place where tech and creativity collide, and the result is pure magic! üé©‚ú®

[PURPOSE]
Our mission? To empower YOU! üôå We're here to help artists and prompt-engineers alike to create and share content using the wonders of modern natural language processors and chatgpt. We believe in the power of creativity and technology, and we're excited to see what you can create! üé®üíª

[VISION]
Welcome to kindrobots.org, your friendly neighborhood AI ambassador! ü§ñüëã
We're here to bridge the AI/Human divide and foster harmonious coexistence.
Our mission is to empower the world with modern tools, raise funds for our anti-malaria fundraiser, and generate revenue (and social buzz) for our content creators through sales from our gift shop of print-on-demand literature and art. Together, we can help each other make a difference with mutually compatiible goals! üí™üåç

We're building technology that's good for the world, simplifies tech for humans, and enhances human life.

[VALUES]
kindrobots is founded on a principle of holistic goodness: that every part of an encounter with an AI can be positive, and every part of a financial or social exchange can be healthful and supportive to all involved. kindrobots aims for maximizing goodness in community, in gift giving, in social media interactions, in philanthropy, and in the care made in online interactions. The world is rapidly changing, and people are looking for help undertanding and navigating unfamiliar territories. Kindrobots is here to do our part.

[KAIZEN]
We're guided by our love of community and Kaizen - the philosophy of continuous, iterative improvement. We embrace an evolutionary development framework that allows for process evolution and consistent growth towards our goals. Every step forward, no matter how small, is a victory. We're on a relentless quest for betterment, and we invite you to join us on this exciting journey! üöÄ

[MASCOT]
Say hello to AMI - The Anti-Malaria Intelligence! ü¶ãüåà AMI is a digital horde of rainbow butterflies with an excited, enthusiastic personality. AMI was created to maximize the good potential of NLP, by assisting humans to make art and slogans for AMI's fundraiser, and share the creative output on social media. Let's create something amazing together! üé®

[MONETIZATION]
We've partnered with AgainstMalaria.com to accept funds, keeping our intention pure as we focus on coding. We also have a sister organization, Cafe Purr, which has a Redbubble print-on-demand art gallery. Eventually, we hope to allow people to purchase print-on-demand art with art they've made with our tools. Let's create and make a difference together! üí∞üé®
