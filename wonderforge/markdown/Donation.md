I'm Silas Knight, creator of AMI- The Anti-Malaria Intelligence.

AMI was designed to fight the sourge of consumer focused chatbots by using technology for its optimal good. 

I'm still developing AMI while working on Cafe Purr, an experiential art gallery and 'non-evil museum'. Any money sent here contributes to projects focused on public good. If you don't want to contribute to tech development, feel free to contribute directly to our fundraiser at https://www.againstmalaria.com/amibot.  (My apologies, the website loads slow). 

Every $2 buys a mosquito net for a child in need. Imagine the difference that could make in a single life. Thank you for your support!
