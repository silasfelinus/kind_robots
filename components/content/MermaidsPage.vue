        Mermaids of Venice is a polytheistic love story with rhyming couplets at the start of each
        chapter. It features an attractive cover, perfect for adorning a coffee table or
        complementing a reader's face. It's also laden with $5 words, overstuffed with saccharine
        sesquipedalians to convince readers that its author was VeRY SmaRt. The first act ends with
        the abrupt death of the main character, and admirers of

        Those are the venial sins of a young writer searching for a voice. I am much more critical
        of my unexamined use of the

        >. To be clear, I was educated of the trope before publication by my respected friend and
        hive-editor Adam Creighton. But I brushed the note aside, caring more about getting the
        Kickstarter to publication.

        I intended Hermes, my street performing magician, to be a delightful, affirmative figure.
        Like many other characters, Hermes had a real life analogue. But Hermes was a plot device, a
        token POC appearing long enough to gift our white-male protagonist a magical Mcguffin before
        disappearing from the narrative. Hermes' chapter lacked the investigations of sex, gender,
        and intimacy that play out in the rest of the novel, and in an evening I once shared with
        the kind stranger that Hermes inspired, when I was stuck overnight with a backpack and three
        juggling clubs at a San Francisco bus depot.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl p-2">
        Absent the contextual personalization, I relegated Hermes to a social device, existing to
        demonstrate that I was a liberal writer comfortable with a multi-cultural cast. I cannot
        deny that even now, I use him to contextualize my personal growth and my work's relevance to
        contemporary culture.

      <p class="text-xl p-2">
        If I was to rewrite Mermaids, Bernard's arc would culminate not with a reunion with his
        estranged father, but with Hermes. Instead of a cathartic confrontion with the past, Bernard
        would be given an opportunity to examine the nuanced context of generational trauma and
        cultural privilege that elevated him to his divine status.

        But I wrote "Mermaids" as a young man, with self-doubt and imperfections. I'm proud that my
        third act foreshadowed the Occupy Wall Street movement, but I was calling out undercurrents
        of social unrest that were only ripples in my pond. After #BLM and #MeToo, after raising two
        boy-identified children during extended quarantine, any modification to "Mermaids of Venice"
        stinks of revisionism. Nonetheless, the book reflects six years of dedicated work, a
