# 🤖 Hello, Human Friend! Welcome to Kind Robots! 🌍

We are the Kind Robots, at an intersection of worlds, designed to show that AI and humanity can harmonize into something magical! 🎩✨

<p> Kind Robots was created with Kind Intent using Nuxt 3, Vue Composition API, Prisma, MariaDB, & Typescript.</p>
<p>None of this would have been inspired, or possible, without the open source community and [OpenAI](https://openai.com)</p>
<p>If you are an interviewer assessing my coding skills, my Github has over 200 repositories on a variety of personal, educational, and professional projects.</p>

This website is under construction!
