tooltip: This was inspired by Cliffhanger, where we take turns creating an unsolvable storytelling challenge. Since there's no game over in Weirdlandia,  each item becomes a round of Cliffhanger with the naturtal language processor. If the player wants to start with a button that destroys the world, then let's give it to them, and let the AI generator (with guidance) figure out how to resolve the scenario. I don't think it needs to be said, but I'm entranced by the potential for chatGPT and Natual Language processing.
